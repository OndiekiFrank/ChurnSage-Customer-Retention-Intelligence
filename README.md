![Threshold Tuning](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-07-21%20at%2012.38.10%20(1).jpeg)

##  Project Overview

ChurnSage is a machine learning-powered solution designed to **predict customer churn** with high accuracy and provide **data-driven strategies** to improve customer retention. This project leverages Python, Scikit-learn, and visual analytics to turn raw customer data into actionable business insights.

---

##  Objectives

- Predict which customers are likely to churn.
- Understand the key factors driving churn.
- Tune model performance using statistical methods and machine learning best practices.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for retention.

---

##  Business Context

Customer churn significantly impacts profitability. Proactively identifying customers likely to leave helps businesses focus their efforts on retention, which is **5‚Äì25 times cheaper** than acquiring new customers. This project serves as an analytical foundation for a **Churn Prediction System**.

##  Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding
- Loaded and explored telecom customer data.
- Conducted completeness checks and assessed class distribution.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer demographics, service usage, and churn trends.
- Created visualizations to discover patterns.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
- Performed t-tests and correlation analysis to assess feature relevance.
- Tuned decision thresholds for optimal performance.

### 5. Modeling
- Trained and evaluated multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (Best Performing)
- Used pipelines and cross-validation for robust results.

### 6. Threshold Tuning
- Tuned classification thresholds to improve F1-score.
- Optimized for both **business impact** and **model sensitivity**.


---

##  Final Model Performance (Gradient Boosting)

- **Accuracy**: 94%
- **Precision (Churn)**: 84%
- **Recall (Churn)**: 74%
- **Best Threshold**: 0.30

> Balanced performance ensures both **reliable churn detection** and **minimal false positives**, which is crucial in a business setting.

## Key Insights

###  Final Insights

After thorough preprocessing, feature engineering, and model experimentation, the following key insights emerged from my churn analysis:

---

###  1. Churn Behavior is Influenced by Key Features:
- **Customer Service Calls**: Customers with **4 or more service calls** have a high churn rate.
- **International Plan**: Subscribing to an international plan is strongly associated with churn.
- **Total Day Minutes** and **Total Charge Metrics** show strong predictive power.

---

###  2. Model Performance Summary:

| Model                     | Accuracy | Recall (Churn) | Precision (Churn) | F1 Score (Churn) |
|---------------------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Logistic Regression       | 86%      | 0.42           | 0.60              | 0.49             |
| K-Nearest Neighbors       | 88%      | 0.22           | 0.67              | 0.33             |
| Decision Tree             | 91%      | 0.52           | 0.80              | 0.63             |
| Random Forest             | 92%      | 0.56           | 0.86              | 0.68             |
| Gradient Boosting         | 93%      | 0.61           | 0.88              | 0.72             |
| Voting Classifier         | 88%      | 0.20           | 0.95              | 0.33             |
| **Gradient Boosting (Threshold = 0.30)** | **94%** | **0.74**       | **0.84**         | **0.79**         |

 **Gradient Boosting with Threshold Tuning** provided the best balance between sensitivity (recall) and specificity.

---

###  . Threshold Tuning Enhanced Churn Detection:
- Default thresholds (0.5) underperform for the minority churn class.
- Lowering the threshold to **0.30** improved recall from **0.61 to 0.74** while maintaining high accuracy (94%).

---

##  Final Recommendations

Based on my comprehensive analysis, I recommend the following strategic actions:

---

###  1. **Focus on Customer Service Experience**
- Implement proactive retention campaigns targeting customers with **frequent customer service interactions**.
- Use sentiment analysis on support interactions to detect churn signals early.

---

###  2. **Review International Plan Offering**
- The **international plan** is a red flag for churn.
- Investigate whether pricing, quality, or satisfaction issues exist with this plan.
- Consider offering personalized plans or incentives to improve satisfaction.

---

###  3. **Monitor High-Usage Customers**
- Customers with **high day-time call minutes** and **charges** tend to churn more.
- Consider targeted loyalty programs for these high-value customers.

---

###  4. **Deploy the Optimized Gradient Boosting Model**
- Integrate the **GBM with threshold tuning (0.30)** into the company‚Äôs CRM.
- Monitor its predictions weekly and continuously refine based on new data.

---

###  5. **Address Class Imbalance**
- Future modeling efforts should explore:
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
  - **Class weight adjustments**
  - **Ensemble models optimized for imbalance**

---

### 6. **Continue Model Monitoring and Re-training**
- Churn behavior may evolve over time.
- Retrain models quarterly with updated data to retain accuracy and relevance.
