    "## 2. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn — the process where customers discontinue using a company's product or service — presents a significant challenge for businesses, especially in competitive and subscription-based industries. It not only impacts revenue, but also increases the cost of customer acquisition and reduces long-term profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I aim to build a data-driven framework that enables early identification of customers likely to churn. My goal is to empower decision-makers with predictive insights that inform timely interventions, customer retention strategies, and improved service personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Many businesses lack the analytical infrastructure to anticipate churn before it happens. Without accurate forecasting, retention efforts are reactive rather than proactive. This leads to avoidable customer losses and missed opportunities for engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "Through this analysis and modeling process, I aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key patterns and factors that influence customer churn.\n",
    "- Develop a predictive machine learning model capable of flagging high-risk customers.\n",
    "- Translate model outcomes into actionable recommendations for business teams.\n",
    "- Demonstrate end-to-end capability in solving a real-world business problem using data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Questions\n",
    "This project aims to answer the following critical questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What behavioral, demographic, or transactional factors contribute to customer churn?\n",
    "- Can I develop a reliable machine learning model to predict churn before it happens?\n",
    "- What strategies or business actions can be informed by these predictive insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, I intend to showcase a complete workflow — from problem understanding to deployment-ready solutions — while aligning technical outputs with strategic business goals.\n"
